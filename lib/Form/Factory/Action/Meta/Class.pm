=head1 NAME

Form::Factory::Action::Meta::Class - The meta-class role for form actions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp::Action::Foo;
  use Form::Factory::Processor;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All form actions have this role attached to its meta-class.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 features

This is a hash of features. The keys are the short name of the feature to attach and the value is a hash of options to pass to the feature's constructor on instantiation.

has features => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'HashRef',
    required => 1,
    default  => sub { {} },
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_controls

  my @attributes = $action->meta->get_controls(@names);

Returns all the controls for this action. This includes controls inherited from parent classes as well. This returns a list of attributes which do L<Form::Factory::Action::Meta::Attribute::Control>.

You may pass a list of control names if you only want a subset of the available controls. If no list is given, all controls are returned.

=cut

sub get_controls {
    my ($meta, @control_names) = @_;
    my @controls;

    if (@control_names) {
        @controls = grep { $_ } 
                     map { $meta->find_attribute_by_name($_) } 
                           @control_names;
    }

    else {
        @controls = $meta->get_all_attributes;
    }

    @controls = sort { $a->placement <=> $b->placement }
                grep { $_->does('Form::Factory::Action::Meta::Attribute::Control') } 
                       @controls;
}

=head2 get_all_features

  my $features = $action->meta->get_all_features;

Returns all the feature specs for the form. This includes all inherited features and features configured in implemented roles as well. These are returned in the same format as the L</features> attribute.

=cut

sub get_all_features {
    my $meta = shift;
    my %all_features;

    # For all the classes implemented, find the features we use
    for my $class (reverse $meta->linearized_isa) {

    }

    # Now, do the same for the roles we implement as well
