=head1 NAME

Form::Factory::Interface - Role for form interface implementations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp::Interface::MyUI;
  use Moose;

  with qw( Form::Factory::Interface );

  sub render_control {
      my ($self, $control, %options) = @_;

      # Draw $control for user
  }

  sub consume_control {
      my ($self, $control, %options) = @_;

      # Consume values from user to fill $control
  }

  package Form::Factory::Interface::Custom::MyUI;
  sub register_implementation { 'MyApp::Interface::MyUI' }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the contract form interface classes must fulfill.

A place for remembering things.

=cut

has stasher => (
    is        => 'ro',
    does      => 'Form::Factory::Stasher',
    required  => 1,
    default   => sub { Form::Factory::Stasher::Memory->new },
    handles   => [ qw( stash unstash ) ],
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 stash

=head2 unstash

See L<Form::Factory::Stash>.

=head2 new_action

  my $action = $interface->new_action('Some::Action::Class', \%options);

Given the name of an action class, it initializes the class for use with this interface. The C<%options> are passed to the constructor.

=cut

sub new_action {
    my ($self, $class_name, $args) = @_;

    Class::Load::load_class($class_name)
        or Carp::croak("cannot load $class_name: $@");

    return $class_name->new( %$args, form_interface => $self );
}

=head2 new_control

  my $control = $interface->new_control($name, \%options);

Given the short name for a control and a hash reference of initialization arguments, return a fully initialized control.

=cut

sub new_control {
    my ($self, $name, $args) = @_;

    my $class_name = Form::Factory->control_class($name);
    return unless $class_name;

    return $class_name->new($args);
}
